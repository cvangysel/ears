=Requirements and prerequisites=

The sources have only two hard dependencies: the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/lemur/ Lemur toolkit] and the STL (which comes with all sane C++ compilers).

EARS has been tested with the following versions of the Lemur toolkit: 4.3, 4.4, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9

=Installing and compiling=
  # download and extract EARS
  # open `Makefile` and set the value of the `Lemur_dir` variable according to your local settings
  # The build is fairly conventional. Go to the EARS directory, and: 
{{{
make clean
make
}}}
