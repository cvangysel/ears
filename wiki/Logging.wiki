#summary Logging and debugging
#labels design

The Logger object is used as follows:

Logger::log(3) << "Log message at debuglevel 3\n";

Any time the Logger object is told to log something at a debug level that is above the global debug level, it ignores it. 

The debug levels are defined as follows:
  # error 
  # warning
  # general log (default level)
  # detailed log 
  # debug 

The global debug level can be specified as a command line parameter.
