=Installing EARS=

==Requirements and prerequisites==

The sources have only two hard dependencies: the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/lemur/ Lemur toolkit] and the STL (which comes with all sane C++ compilers).

===Installing the Lemur toolkit===
See the [http://www.lemurproject.org/tutorials/begin_installing-1.php Lemur tutorial].

Note: EARS has been tested with the following versions of the Lemur toolkit: 4.3, 4.4, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.10

==Installing and compiling==
  # download and extract EARS
  # open `Makefile` and set the value of the `Lemur_dir` variable according to your local settings
  # The build is fairly conventional. Go to the EARS directory, and: 
{{{
make clean
make
}}}

=Using EARS=

Usage will be demonstrated on the [ExampleDataSet "ILPS Abstracts" data set], shipped with the EARS distribution. 

==Indexing the collection==
From the `EARS/examples/` directory, execute
  * `LEMURPATH/bin/BuildIndex BuildIndex.conf` for indexing with Lemur
  * `LEMURPATH/bin/IndriBuildIndex IndriBuildIndex.conf` for indexing with Indri
where `LEMURPATH` is the location of the Lemur installation.
