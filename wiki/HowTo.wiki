=Installing EARS=

==Requirements and prerequisites==

The sources have only two hard dependencies: the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/lemur/ Lemur toolkit] and the STL (which comes with all sane C++ compilers).

===Installing the Lemur toolkit===
See the [http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lemur/wiki/Compiling%20and%20Installing Compiling and Installing] section on the [http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lemur/wiki Lemur Toolkit and Indri Search Engine Wiki].

Note: EARS has been tested with the following versions of the Lemur toolkit: 4.3, 4.4, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.10

==Installing and compiling==
  # download and extract EARS
  # open `Makefile` and set the value of the `Lemur_dir` variable according to your local settings
  # The build is fairly conventional. Go to the EARS directory, and type `make`
    * If you need to re-compile it for any reason, you may want to issue `make clean` and then `make` 

=Using EARS=

Usage will be demonstrated on the [ExampleDataSet "ILPS Abstracts" data set], shipped with the EARS distribution. 

==Indexing the collection==
From the `EARS/examples/` directory, execute
  * `{Lemur_dir}/bin/BuildIndex BuildIndex.conf` for indexing with Lemur
  * `{Lemur_dir}/bin/IndriBuildIndex IndriBuildIndex.conf` for indexing with Indri
where `{Lemur_dir}` is the location of your Lemur installation.

More details on about the indexing process and the differences between index types are given on [http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lemur/wiki/Building%20Indexes this page].
