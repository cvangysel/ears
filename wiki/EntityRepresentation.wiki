#summary Entity representation
#labels design,manual

  * Each entity is recognized by a unique identifier, the `entityID`.
    * `entityID` is a string that contains only non-whitespace characters
  * Since there might exist more than one representations of the same entity (e.g., a person recognized by name, email address, or social security number) an entity may have multiple aliases. 
    * `entityAlias` is a string that contains only non-whitespace characters
    * each `entityAlias` is assigned to an `entityID`, therefore, it identifies the entity unambiguously
