#summary Description of the association finding tasks and models

EARS implements a generative probabilistic modeling framework for capturing associations between entities and topics. We employ two main families of models, both based on generative language modeling techniques, for calculating the probability of a query topic (q) being associated with an entity (e), P(q|e). According to one family of models (Model 1) we build a textual representation (i.e., language model) for each entity, according to the documents associated with that entity. From this representation we then estimate the probability of the query topic given the entity's language model. In our second group of models (Model 2) we first identify important documents for a given a topic, and then determine which entities are most closely associated with these documents.

  * *topDocNum* is an optional parameter that could be used to set an upper limit on the number of relevant documents to be taken into account.
