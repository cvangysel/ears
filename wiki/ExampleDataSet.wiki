= ILPS Abstracts =

It is a toy-sized data set created for demonstrating the usage of EARS. The collection contains abstracts of papers, co-authored by researchers from the [http://ilps.science.uva.nl/ ILPS group at the University of Amsterdam]. Note that this is a random sample; neither the documents nor the results derived from it should not be treated as a true reflection of the expertise of the people contained within the collection.

In sum, the data set contains 43 documents (abstracts), 61 entities (people), 161 document-entity associations, and 10 queries.
