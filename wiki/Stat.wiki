=Statistics=

To be able to measure not only effectiveness, but also efficiency of the implemented models, EARS has been equipped with the ability to count how many times certain operations were called/issued during the computation process.

To display statistics, you need to run EARS with [Logging debug level] =debug= or =debugall=.

*Important note* Statistics are not collected during smoothing parameter estimation, only during the "core" processing steps.

The following operations are recorded: 

|| *Operation* || *Description* || *Used in* ||
|| P(t) || Get collection probability for term t || M1,M2 || 
|| n(t,d) || Get the frequency of term t from document d || M1,M2 || 
|| n(t,e) || Get the frequency of term t from the language model of entity e || M1 ||
|| entityDocNum || Get the number of documents associated with the entity ||  M1 ||
|| entityDocs || Get the list of documents associated with the entity || M1 ||
|| docEntities || Get the list of entities associated with the document || M2 ||
|| termInfoList || Get the term list for a document || M1 ||
|| docInfoList || Get the document list for a term || M2 ||


Operations marked by * are not computed by default as they slow computation down. If you want these computed change the line =#define DETAILED_STAT 0= to =#define DETAILED_STAT 1= in includes/Stat.hpp (and don't forget to recompile)!
