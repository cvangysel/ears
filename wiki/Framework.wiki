#labels design,implementation,modeling

The tasks of finding and profiling entities are performed by completing the following steps in a sequential order:
  # Loading parameters and data
  # Initializing
  # Generating associations
  # Generating output


This pipeline is implemented in the `AssociationFramework` class and is executed in its `run` method.

Below, we discuss each of these steps in detail.
