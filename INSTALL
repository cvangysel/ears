Installing EARS


==Requirements and prerequisites==

The sources have only two hard dependencies: the Lemur toolkit and the
STL (which comes with all sane C++ compilers).


==Installing the Lemur toolkit==

1. Download the Lemur toolkit from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/lemur/]

2. See the Compiling and Installing section on the Lemur Toolkit and Indri
Search Engine Wiki.
[http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lemur/wiki/Compiling%20and%20Installing]


==Installing and compiling EARS==

1. open Makefile and set the value of the Lemur_dir variable
according to your local settings

2. type 'make'
(If you need to re-compile it for any reason, you may want to
issue 'make clean' first and then 'make')
