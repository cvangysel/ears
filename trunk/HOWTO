Using EARS


Usage will be demonstrated on the "ILPS Abstracts" data set, shipped
with the EARS distribution.

==Indexing the collection==

The document collection needs to be indexed using the Lemur toolkit.

   1. Change to the EARS directory
      This step is crucial as paths are set relative to this directory.
      Alternatively, you may edit the config files and change the paths 
      to absolute ones.
   2. Execute either of the two:
      - "{Lemur_dir}/bin/IndriBuildIndex \
         examples/ilps_abstracts/conf/IndriBuildIndex.conf \
         examples/ilps_abstracts/stopwords/stopwords.indri"
        for building an Indri index (preferred)
      - "{Lemur_dir}/bin/BuildIndex \
         examples/ilps_abstracts/conf/BuildIndex.conf "
        for building a KeyFile index, 

where {Lemur_dir} is the location of your Lemur installation. 


==Finding and profiling entities==

EARS can help you in two entity related tasks:

    - *finding entities* is about retrieving entities for a query 
      topic ("Which entities are associated with the topic?"). In our 
      example, we rank people with respect to their expertise given a 
      particular topical area. Therefore, for each query, a ranked 
      list of entities (names) is returned.
    - *entity profiling* is the other way around: for each entity we 
      return topics ("Which topics are associated with the entity?") 
      In our example, topics are ranked according to the person's 
      proficiency in each. 

===Syntax===

The syntax of the ears program is the following: ears <command>
<paramfile> [debug_level]

Where

    * <command> is either ef (for entity finding) or 
                          ep (for entity profiling)
    * <paramfile> is a parameter file 
    * debug_level (optionally) is the reporting level 

===Parameter files===

There are sample parameter files for the two baseline models in 
the examples/ilps_abstracts/conf directory: ears_model1.conf and 
ears_model2.conf for Models 1 and 2, respectively.

    * If you indexed the collection using a KeyFile index, you need 
      to edit these files, and replace the line 
      <index>examples/ilps_abstracts/index</index>
      with <index>examples/ilps_abstracts/index/index.key</index> 

===Example usage===

Finding experts using Model 1:

  ears ef examples/ilps_abstracts/conf/ears_model1.conf

The output will look like:
